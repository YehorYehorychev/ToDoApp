# ToDo Application

## Overview

This repository contains a simple **ToDo application** for Android, developed in Kotlin. The application is designed as a demonstration of my ability to both **develop and test native Android applications**.

## Features

- Add, edit, and delete tasks.
- Simple and user-friendly interface.
- Local database to save tasks.

## Testing

I have written **end-to-end (E2E) tests** for the application using the **Espresso testing framework**. The tests cover:

- Adding a new task.
- Editing an existing task.
- Deleting a task.
- Verifying the UI components and task flow.

## Purpose

This project serves as a small demo to showcase my skills in:

1. **Native Android development** using Kotlin.
2. **Automated testing** of Android applications with Espresso.

Feel free to explore the code and test implementation. Feedback is always welcome!

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YehorYehorychev/ToDoApp.git
